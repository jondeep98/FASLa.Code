In this paper, the generalized mixture of standard logistic and skew logistic is introduced as a new class of distribution. 
Some important mathematical properties of this novel distribution are discussed along with a graphical presentation of the density function. 
Simulation study as well as real life aplication for the new distribution are also conducted.
